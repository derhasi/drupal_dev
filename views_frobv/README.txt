Views Filters Reduce Options by View
------------------------------------ created by derhasi

This module adds the ability to an exposed filter to reduce its options array to
the result set of a specified view. Therefore you can select a field of a view
in the interface. Additionaly you can allow to pass arguments or exposed filter
values of the view to the option view.

This module was inspired by views_filters_selective of views_hacks project.
